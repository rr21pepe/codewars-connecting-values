# Connecting values

Given an array of integers ```arr```, a value ```val```, and a coordinate ```coord``` in the
form ```[row, column]```, return an array of all of the coordinates that contain the given
value and are connected to the original coordinate by the given value. Connections may be
made horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. If the value of ```arr``` at ```coord``` is
not equal to ```val``` return ```[]```. The coordinates must include the original coordinate
and may be in any order.
